A community problem that I want to solve with technology is creating an app to help people find free parking spot around thier area.
It is hard enough to find a parking spot but on top of that some people have to pay for meter parking. I want to create an app that takes into account of all the free parking space around the area and let the user know which one is closet to them, and send notification.
In this app I want it to send user notification when the nearest parking space will open up and they can also book book the free parking space.
